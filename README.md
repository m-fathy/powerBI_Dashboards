Overview
This project involves two main components: data integration and cleansing for two distinct client datasets and the creation of a Power BI dashboard to provide actionable insights. The project aims to consolidate data from Excel sources into an Oracle database, clean and prepare the data for analysis, and then visualize the results in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Key Project Details
Data Integration and Cleansing (Deadline: Tuesday)
Data Source Import:

Import Excel datasets from two separate clients into an Oracle database for centralized data storage and management.
Data Cleansing and Transformation:

Perform data cleansing, including handling missing values, duplicate records, and data quality issues.
Transform and structure the data to make it suitable for analysis.
Data Aggregation and Enrichment:

Aggregate data where necessary to provide meaningful insights.
Enrich the data by combining it with relevant external datasets or sources.
Data Quality Assurance:

Implement quality checks and validation processes to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Power BI Dashboard Development (Deadline: Wednesday)
Dashboard Design and Visualization:

Create a visually appealing and user-friendly Power BI dashboard.
Incorporate interactive charts, graphs, and tables to showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights.
Client-Specific Views:

Develop separate views within the dashboard for each client to maintain data confidentiality and provide tailored insights.
Testing Script Development:

Generate testing scripts for each chart, graph, or visualization component in the Power BI dashboard.
Ensure the testing scripts adhere to an agreed-upon format, covering data accuracy, functionality, and responsiveness.
User Training and Documentation:

Provide training to end-users on how to use the Power BI dashboard effectively.
Create documentation to guide users on data interpretation and dashboard navigation.
Performance Optimization:

Optimize dashboard performance for smooth and responsive user experiences, even with large datasets.
